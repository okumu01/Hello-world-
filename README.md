# Hello-world-
New IT
I am glad to learn more information about data analysis. It is very interesting, looking forward to learn more as time goes. New Jersey is a beautiful place though the weather changes a lot as it is very cold at times. 
The changes made are to ensure all learners are able to work on the new task allocated by the lecturer.
